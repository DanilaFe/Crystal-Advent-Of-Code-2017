# Crystal Advent Of Code-2017
Solutions to Advent of Code 2017 written in Crystal. These should be pretty self-contained.
Solutions that require big inputs look for the file named day[num].txt, which should
contain your puzzle input. To run, say, the solution to day 1, use the command
```
crystal day1_1.cr
```
If you wish to time the solution, use
```
crystal build --release day1_1.cr
time ./day1_1
```
